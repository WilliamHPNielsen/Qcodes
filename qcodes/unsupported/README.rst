Unsupported
===========

Welcome to the unsupported part of QCoDeS. Entrance at own risk.

This folder - which might eventually become its own repository - is for user-contributed code that
the core developer team can not support or maintain.

Examples of code that belongs in here include (but are not limited to):
- Instrument drivers for instruments that the core team does not have access to
- Legacy code that is incompatible with newer versions of QCoDeS
